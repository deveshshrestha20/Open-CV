Overview

This repository contains six lab assignments related to Image Processing using OpenCV, Matplotlib, NumPy, and Pandas. Each assignment is implemented in a separate Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file.

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed before running the notebooks:

pip install opencv-python matplotlib numpy pandas jupyter

Alternatively, you can install the required packages using the requirements.txt file:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Lab Assignments

Each lab focuses on different aspects of image processing:

ðŸ“Œ Lab 1: Introduction to Image Processing

Loading and displaying images using OpenCV and Matplotlib

Converting images between color spaces (RGB, Grayscale, HSV)

Accessing pixel values and modifying images

ðŸ“Œ Lab 2: Image Transformations

Image resizing, cropping, and aspect ratio preservation

Image rotation and flipping

Image annotation (drawing lines, shapes, and text)

ðŸ“Œ Lab 3: Image Enhancement and Filtering

Applying different filters: Blur, Gaussian, Median, and Bilateral filtering

Image thresholding (Binary, Adaptive, Otsu's method)

Histogram equalization for contrast enhancement

ðŸ“Œ Lab 4: Edge Detection and Contour Analysis

Applying Sobel, Prewitt, and Canny edge detection

Finding and drawing contours

Convex hull and bounding boxes

ðŸ“Œ Lab 5: Morphological Operations

Dilation, erosion, opening, and closing operations

Morphological gradient and top-hat transformation

Removing noise from binary images

ðŸ“Œ Lab 6: Image Segmentation and Object Detection

Thresholding and region-based segmentation

Watershed algorithm for separating objects

Object detection using contour properties
