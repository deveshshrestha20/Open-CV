# Image Processing Lab Assignments

## Overview
This repository contains six lab assignments related to Image Processing using OpenCV, Matplotlib, NumPy, and Pandas. Each assignment is implemented in a separate Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following libraries installed before running the notebooks:

```bash
pip install opencv-python matplotlib numpy pandas jupyter
```

Alternatively, you can install the required packages using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Lab Assignments
Each lab focuses on different aspects of image processing:

### ðŸ“Œ **Lab 1: Introduction to Image Processing**
- Image Creation and Image Display
- Accessing Image Properties
- Color Space Conversion
- Sampling and Quantization
- Basic Image Manipulation ( resize, crop, rotate, flip, annotate )
- Pixel Neighborhood Analysis ( connectivity, distance measure )


### ðŸ“Œ **Lab 2: Image Transformations**

## How to Run the Notebooks
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-processing-labs.git
   cd image-processing-labs
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open and run each lab notebook (Lab1.ipynb, Lab2.ipynb, etc.)
